The aim of the project is to analyze two sets of documents on a selected topic, in which two separate topics/categories/groups can be distinguished, and books by the same author.

Project stages:

     Preparation of the text corpus by cleaning and normalizing the text and reducing the sparsity of the occurrence matrix.

     Preparing word clouds: words that appear simultaneously in all documents and unique words that appear only in individual documents.

     Checking whether the adopted categories/groups reflecting the adopted dichotomy appear in the examined documents, using grouping and thread models.

     Construction of three classifiers using the classification algorithm: binary, logarithmic and TfIdf.

     Selection of the best classifier based on measures calculated from the confusion matrix and interpretation of the results.

     Determining the mood polarization index for the examined documents.

The project used data from two books by Mark Twain: "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" and "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn".
