## Mini projects using NLP

**COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF MARK TWAIN'S BOOKS**

The aim of the project is to analyze two sets of documents on a selected topic, in which grouping was carried out, a thread model, the construction of classifiers, a sentiment polarization index and word clouds were used.

**TIDY TEXT LIBRARY**

The aim of the project was to prepare a presentation on a selected programming library in Python or R, which allows for effective text preparation. The R language and the Tidy Text library were used to implement this project.

**WORDCLOUD**

The project consisted of preparing a word cloud or a column chart for the 50 most frequently used words based on bag-of-words for two groups of documents that reflected a certain dichotomy. An analysis of 1,000 tweets was chosen to compare two car brands: Audi and BMW.
